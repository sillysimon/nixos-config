# NixOS configuration

**This is a branch for an old version of nixos, the most up to date one will always be in main**

This repository houses all my NixOS configurations as a backup. I just started so some things may not be correct.

## Structure
- Root
    - here you'll find my active configs
    - there is also a license file and a link list to resources I used
- modules
    - here are all the modules I built for my configs
- default configs
    - default configs generated by the installer and made by me as a template
## Sources

These configs were made by modifying the default config from the installer with help from external resources.

I try my best to mention these in `Links.md` and as comments. Should you find some I forgot, please let me know by opening an issue.
